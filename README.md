## Hi there 👋

I am Narmin, a Frontend Developer. I build interactive and responsive Web Applications using modern frameworks. So, I specialize in React, TypeScript, and modern UI frameworks such as Tailwind CSS and Material UI. I care about clean code, performance optimazation of the application, intuitive user experiences, and efficient API integration. I’m never satisfied with what I know, so I constantly explore new tools and best practices in frontend development. I'm currently pursuing a Master's Degree in IT Cyber Security in Poland. Beyond work and study, I’m constantly exploring new frontend technologies and best practices to improve my craft and deliver better solutions.
